// A variable is a named memory location that can hold a value. Variables can
// be used to store a wide range of data types, such as numbers, strings, and
// arrays. A variable is declared by specifying its name, data type, and
// optionally an initial value. Once a variable is declared, it can be read
// potentially updated in other parts of the program.
